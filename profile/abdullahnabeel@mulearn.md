About Me
A budding tech aficionado, I've recently embarked on my journey into the world of technology, making steady strides. My innate curiosity and determination have been the driving forces behind my accelerated learning and growth in this domain.

Leadership and Influence
While I'm still at the early stages of my career, I've shown promise in leadership during group projects and team tasks. During my high school years , I took the initiative to organize study groups, assisting peers in understanding complex subjects, which inadvertently honed my skills in influencing and guiding fellow learners.

Networking
Recognizing the importance of connections in the tech industry, I've been actively attending tech meetups, workshops, and webinars to expand my network. My plan with the Top 100 community is to immerse myself in learning sessions, actively engage in discussions, and collaborate on projects, helping me both share and acquire knowledge.

As a Top 100 Member
Being relatively new to the tech scene, I see the Top 100 as an incredible opportunity to be surrounded by experienced professionals, learning from their experiences and gaining insights that can shape my budding career. Being in this esteemed community would provide me with the exposure and mentorship essential for my growth.

Career Plan
In the immediate future, I'm focused on acquiring certifications and attending workshops to deepen my tech proficiency. My long-term vision is to contribute to Kerala's Startup Ecosystem by potentially launching a startup that leverages technology to address local challenges or by joining a tech firm where I can contribute meaningfully with the skills I am cultivating.

Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem
Kerala, with its educational infrastructure and talent pool, is poised to grow in the tech startup scene. For someone at the beginning of their tech journey like me, it's essential that Kerala strengthens its grassroots tech education, offers more hands-on workshops, and creates incubation centers for novices. This can set the stage for innovation, attracting budding tech enthusiasts and positioning Kerala as a nurturing ground for nascent tech talent.
